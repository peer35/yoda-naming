Naming Conventions Project Folders

In order to create a clear overview of the tool usage by different faculties and departments, it is preferable the naming conventions in use are identical over various tools provided by VU Library and IT.
The form chosen is as follows; The faculty acronym, followed by the department acronym, followed by the title of the project. Each segment is separated by an underscore “_”, see template below:

[Faculty Acronym]_[Department Arconym]_[Project Title]

Example: BETA_CPS_xxx

Adding Acronyms to the List

If the faculty or department is missing add them to the list. The Faculties tend to have a predetermined acronym, therefore do not create your own interpretation.
If a department does not have an acronym, check the naming convention in Pure to determine the most logical acronym and add that to the list below, in order to create consistency in the names in use.
